                    <p> On September 27th,the director and Chinese director of Texas Southern University Confucius Institute (TSUCI); Dr. Roger Hart and Dr. Xiao Yi, along with Texas Sothern's Chinese  Prof. Xiaobin Hu, Lina Fa, accompanied by students of Texas Southern University Confucius Institute Chinese classes. Volunteer teacher and assistant Chinese director Zhuo Li, volunteer teacher Yabao Wang were also in attendance at PetroChina International (America), Inc. (PCIA). <p>
                    <p> China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is the world’s 3rd largest oil company based in China and plays a leading role in China’s petroleum industry.  CNPC integrates the business portfolios of both an oil company and an oilfield service provider. With operations covering all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry. This visit was heavily admired by the students. They all agreed that the trip had a significant impact on their life and they have gained much from this experience.<p>
                    <p> President of PCIA, Chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce --- Houston, Mr. Shaolin Li, vice president of PCIA, Mr. Mark A. Jensen and Assistant president Ms. Yijia Zhao welcomed the visiting group. Mr. Shaolin Li introduced general situation of CNPC, business model of PICA. He also interacted with students, gave humorous answers to students’ question and shared his own life experience and insights. He told student, “Business is making money and losing money. But the most essential thing is making money.”<p>
                    <p> Mr. Mark A. Jensen, the vice president of PCIA, gave a presentation of organization chart, corporation culture and ideas. He typically used the theme of “East Meets West” to share the culture shock that he encountered when he worked in a Chinese corporation located in Houston. He encouraged students to learn Mandarin and learn it well, to catch every opportunity to experience Chinese culture, because that would become your irreplaceable advantages. At last, Mr. Mark A. Jensen welcomed TSU students to work here as an intern.<p>
                    <p> After the presentation, Mr. Mark A. Jensen took students to visit the office and assigned department leaders to introduce the main business of each department. This activity really helped students to learn more about CNPC and inspire them to work in a Chinese company, even abroad in China.<p>
                    <p> This is the first time that TSU Confucius Institute integrated Chinese language courses with language practice and to offer an internship opportunity at a Fortune Global 500 company. TSU Confucius Institute will continue to bring visitation programs as well as providing internships and employment opportunities in a Chinese overseas company with the future development of this new project. We will also seek more chances to create internship opportunities for TSU students to motivate them to learn Chinese and know a modern China. <p>
