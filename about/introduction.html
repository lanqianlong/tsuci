<h1 class="Heading">Texas Southern University Confucius Institute</h1>

    <p>The Confucius Institute at Texas Southern University serves students, faculty members, staff and community members by fostering exchange and dialogue. The first of its kind in the greater Houston metropolitan area and one of 226 centers worldwide, the institute is a hub that brings different groups together. The institute has a three-pronged approach, dedicated to providing greater Houston with courses, programs, events, and services related to China and Chinese cultures.</p>
	
	<p>The primary focus is on increasing employment opportunities for TSU students through language training, cross-cultural exchange and professional development programs.</p>
	
	<p>A secondary focus involves using the institute as an academic forum for intellectual discovery and exchange. This includes a scholar lecture series in the areas of business, law, science, medicine, and technology exchange and commerce related to China.</p>
	
	<p>Our third focus is on community and relationship building through educational and fun-filled workshops, events and performances designed to bring people together and inspire them to explore the diversity that China has to offer.</p>
	
	<p>The TSU Confucius Institute remains a strong partnership with Beijing Jiatong University and has the full support of the Board of Regents: Dr. Danille Taylor, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Behavioral Sciences; who along with Wendy Adair, Vice President for University Advancement, traveled to China last summer to discuss the particulars of the Institute and partnership and the benefits of locating the Institute at TSU; as well as the support of Dr. Sunny E. Ohia, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Research.</p>
