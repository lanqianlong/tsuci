	<p>TSU students will have the exciting opportunity to spend two weeks in China during the summer to develop their language skills and learn firsthand about Chinese culture. Participants will spend one week in Beijing at <a href="http://en.njtu.edu.cn">Beijing Jiaotong University</a>&mdash;one of China’s premier universities&mdash;studying Chinese and visiting cultural sites in Beijing; participants will then travel by high-speed rail to Shanghai for several days, and then return to Beijing. Students who wish to receive credit can, on successful completion of the program, receive three or six university credits at TSU. Most in-country costs will be supported by Confucius Institute Headquarters and Beijing Jiaotong University, and the TSU Confucius Institute will provide additional financial support.<!--, so that the cost to students is estimated to be the cost of airfare plus various incidentals.--> In order to be eligible for the trip, students should take at least one semester of Chinese language through the TSU Department of Foreign Languages, or, in the alternative, sign up for a Confucius Institute Continuing Education course in spring 2017.</p>
	
	<p><!--Completed applications submitted by <strong>November 1, 2016</strong> will receive first consideration.
