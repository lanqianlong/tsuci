<p>The purpose of the Educators China Trip is to introduce Houston educators to key aspects of contemporary China, Chinese culture, and Chinese education. Participation is by invitation only; all participants should be interested in cooperating with the Confucius Institute or planning to open Chinese classes in their own schools. The delegation will include approximately 10 Houston-area educators and one group leader from TSUCI. The trip will take participants to Beijing for 7 days and to Suzhou (near Shanghai) for 3 days. Planned educational activities include the following: a visit TSU’s partner university, Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU); four visits to observe Chinese primary/secondary schools; and a visit to Confucius Institute Headquarters (CIHQ) together with a meeting with CIHQ representatives. A second important focus of the trip is to introduce participants to contemporary China and Chinese culture. Planned cultural activities include the following: visits to famous tourist attractions, such as the Great Wall, Palace Museum, Temple of Heaven, and Beijing 2008 Olympic complex; martial arts and Beijing opera performances; and visits to Suzhou’s classic gardens—Tiger Hill, Lion Grove Garden, and the Humble Administrator’s Garden. Our planned itinerary is below.  </p>
<p>We estimate the cost to participants will be $1800. In-country costs, including most expenses for travel, lodging, and meals will be covered by CIHQ. Costs to participants include the following: roundtrip airfare, approximately $1300; TSUCI administrative fees, $300; PRC visa fees, $150; supplemental insurance coverage, $50; and personal expenses. Participant costs may be more if airfares increase significantly. A list of expenses is below.   </p>
<p>All invitees must be approved by CIHQ. If you do not have a passport, please immediately apply for a passport with expedited service. Participants should pay a deposit of $1300 to cover airfare by September 15 and pay the remaining balance no later than October 1, 2014.</p>
<p>We will have an orientation meeting, for invitees only, on September 9, 2014 from 5:00 to 6:00 PM at the TSU Confucius Institute, located in the Martin Luther King Building, Room 302. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Roger Hart by e-mail at <a href="mailto:HartRP@TSU.edu?subject=Educators China Trip">HartRP@TSU.edu</a>. </p>
