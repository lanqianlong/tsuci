                    <p>Local time on October 7. The Chinese directors and American directors at three Confucius Institutes, and Chinese teachers and volunteer teachers gathered at Texas Southern University Confucius Institute, holding “The First Meeting of Greater Houston Confucius Institutes” in order to  discuss “The Greater Houston Confucius Institute Council Constitution ". Finally "The Greater Houston Confucius Institute Union" was successfully established. There are three Confucius Institutes in the Greater Houston area: the Confucius Institute at Texas A & M University, Confucius Institute at Texas A & M University, and Texas Southern University Confucius Institute.<p>
                    <p>The three Confucius Institutes shared their thoughts and prospects for their development. Dr. Roger Hart, the American director of Confucius Institute at Texas Southern University, introduced the relationship between the Confucius Institute and the University. He explained that Confucius Institute helps American students understand contemporary Chinese in today's world correctly. The Chinese director of Confucius Institute at Texas Southern University, Prof. Yi Xiao, reported the purpose and significance of establishing the Confucius Institute in the Greater Houston area. Houston is becoming the fourth largest city in the United States, and the demand for Chinese learning is growing rapidly<p>
                    <p>In April 2017, China’s chairman Xi Jinping and America’s president Trump, held a meeting with the US heads of state in Florida, stressing that "The two sides should strengthen cultural exchanges and expand friendly exchanges between the two peoples, promote inter-school cooperation, tourism cooperation, expand artistic exchanges and strengthen Sports cooperation, carry out medical and health cooperation, consolidate the basis of public relations between the two countries, and provide more positive energy to promote the healthy development between US and China. " The establishment of the Confucius Institute in the Greater Houston area is not only in line with the development and needs of the times, but also in line with the two peoples’ common interest.<p>
                    <p>The meeting adopted the "Greater Houston Regional Confucius Institute Union". Dr. Roger Hart, the director of the Confucius Institute at Texas Southern University, was elected as the first Chairman. The vice-chairman is from the Confucius Institute at Texas A & M University. The Chinese director of the Confucius Institute at Texas Southern University, Prof. Yi Xiao, was appointed as the secretary-general . A board meeting is scheduled to hold in April every year, to formulate annual work plans, and exchange cooperation programs. It is believed that the establishment of the Confucius Institute will have a positive impact on the education and cultural exchange in the Greater Houston area and in the Southern United States.<p>
